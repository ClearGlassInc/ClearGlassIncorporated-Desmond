# ClearGlass Interface System

How the site stays one system across 143 pages — what is shared, what is
deliberately not, and how a regression gets caught.

## What was already here

This is not a greenfield design system. The homepage-derived visual language
already existed and was already widely adopted before this pass:

| Layer | File | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tokens + components | `assets/css/cg-design-system.css` | Homepage-derived tokens (prism palette, glass surfaces, radii, motion) and the shared component layer |
| Token primitives | `tokens.css` | Namespaced `--cg-*` brand primitives |
| Accent remap | `theme.css` | Maps legacy per-page accent variables onto the blue-violet identity |
| Rhythm + cards | `brand-system.css` | Typography rhythm, card/panel treatment, CTA geometry |
| Interaction | `ui.css`, `buttons.css` | Focus rings, hover physics, button geometry |
| Navigation | `nav.js` | Injected glass top bar, product catalog, mobile drawer |
| Command layer | `control-surface.js` | Command cluster + palette on 35 pages |

**The homepage is a light "crystal/prism" theme** — white/off-white surfaces,
`Cormorant Garamond` + `Urbanist` + `IBM Plex Mono`, and a prism gradient
(`#38bdf8 → #a78bfa → #f472b6 → #fbbf24 → #34d399`). Any future token work
should extend that, not a dark palette.

## What this pass added

The visual layer was in good shape. The gaps were in **enforcement**,
**keyboard access**, and **content honesty**.

### 1. A site-wide adoption gate — `tools/design_system.py`

Consistency held only by convention, and convention had already failed: 54
pages were missing the token layer and 11 were missing the navigation entirely.
The generator enforces four contracts and is idempotent:

```bash
python3 tools/design_system.py            # apply fixes in place
python3 tools/design_system.py --check     # exit 1 if any route is stale (CI)
python3 tools/design_system.py --report    # regenerate DESIGN_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md
```

| Contract | Enforced on |
| --- | --- |
| `assets/css/cg-design-system.css` is linked | every non-exempt route |
| `nav.js` is loaded | every non-exempt route |
| `cg-a11y.js` is loaded | every non-exempt route |
| Twitter/X card present | every indexable route |

Metadata is **derived, never invented**: cards are built from `og:*` first, then
`<title>`/`<meta name="description">`. A page with nothing to borrow is
reported, not given filler.

Exemptions live in `EXEMPT` / `NAV_EXEMPT` in the tool, each paired with a
reason, and a test asserts every exemption still points at a real page.

### 2. The keyboard contract — `cg-a11y.js`

The site runs **two navigation systems**. `control-surface.js` sets
`window.__cgNavLoaded = true` on purpose to supersede `nav.js` on 35 pages. That
is a legitimate product decision, but it meant the accessibility contract
depended on which nav a page happened to load — and the `control-surface.js`
pages shipped with **no skip link and no `aria-current` at all**.

`cg-a11y.js` is a small, dependency-free module that runs regardless of which
nav is active and guarantees:

- a **bypass link** ("Skip to main content") as the first tab stop (WCAG 2.4.1),
  with a target resolved even on pages authored without `<main>`;
- **`aria-current="page"`** on the active destination, in either nav's
  containers (`#cg-global-nav` / `.cgcs-*`);
- **external-link marking** (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`, `data-cg-external`).

It is idempotent and additive — on a `nav.js` page the skip link already exists
and the module leaves it alone. Because both navs inject asynchronously, active
route marking retries through a `MutationObserver` with a 6-second lifetime.

### 3. Navigation accessibility — `nav.js`

| Added | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Skip link + `<main>` targeting | No bypass mechanism existed (2 of 96 pages had one) |
| `aria-current="page"` | Active route had no accessible signal |
| `visibility:hidden` on the closed catalog | **The closed mega-menu kept 76 links in the tab order** — a keyboard user had to tab the entire product catalog to reach the page |
| Real disclosure button (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) | The catalog was hover/`:focus-within` only, with no way to close it |
| Escape + focus restore on the catalog | — |
| Focus trap, Escape, and focus restore on the mobile drawer | Drawer could be scroll-closed while focus was inside it |
| Command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`) | Sourced from the same public route tables the nav renders, so it can never expose an internal console |
| Scroll-retract guard | The bar no longer hides while its own drawer is open |

### 4. Content honesty

Twelve instances across seven pages asserted authority the company does not
have. All were removed:

| Page | Was | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blog/index.html` | "military-grade command surface" | "defence-in-depth command surface" |
| `clearsight.html` | "Defense-grade computer vision" | "Production-grade computer vision" |
| `government.html` | "government-grade compliance" | "public-sector compliance" |
| `government.html` | "Request a classified briefing" | "Request a technical briefing" |
| `guardian.html` | `CG//SI//NF` (×2), "Classified · Eyes Only", "CLASSIFIED · COMMAND INTERFACE" | `CLEARGLASS`, "Governed · Access Controlled", "GOVERNED · COMMAND INTERFACE" |
| `clearglass-nexus.html` | `CG//SI//NF` + "CLASSIFIED · COMMAND INTERFACE" | `CLEARGLASS` + "GOVERNED · COMMAND INTERFACE" |
| `blog/frontier-…-biosecurity.html` | "CLASSIFIED BRIEFING · LEVEL: EYES ONLY" | "ANALYTICAL BRIEFING · OPEN-SOURCE" |
| `conduit.html` | "Classified-command motion" | "Command-grade motion" |
| `clearglass-ultra.html` | ticker: "GOVERNED ACTIONS ▲ 12,408", "APPROVAL LATENCY 3.2m", "WRAITH-OMEN CLASSIFIED" | "▲ APPROVAL-GATED", "HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP", "HORIZON WARNING" |

`CG//SI//NF` imitates US intelligence control markings (SI = Special
Intelligence, NF = NOFORN). The `clearglass-ultra.html` ticker presented
invented telemetry as live status.

**Deliberately left alone** — these are accurate, not violations:

- `UNCLASSIFIED / NON-CLASSIFIÉ` banners on `index.html`, `government.html`,
  `procurement-legal-tech.html`, `percival-os.html`. They assert the *absence*
  of classification and are labelled demo instances.
- Ordinary prose: "classified as harmful", "hashed, classified and
  deduplicated", "open, unclassified doctrine".
- `blog/clearglass-platform-audit-2026.html` uses `"defense-grade"` in scare
  quotes to argue *against* the term.
- `counter-uas-commercialization-os.html` renamed its `CLASSIFIED` pipeline
  stage to `CATEGORIZED`. The original was the correct ML term
  (`DETECTED → CORRELATED → CLASSIFIED → REVIEWED`), but the page's subject
  matter made it ambiguous and the rename costs no meaning.

## Verification

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_design_system.py -q   # 18 contract tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -q                         # full suite (1190 passed)
python3 tools/design_system.py --check              # adoption gate
python3 tools/internal_links.py --check             # link graph freshness
python3 -m ruff check .

# Browser-level behaviour (Playwright + the pre-installed Chromium)
npm i --no-save playwright
node tests/browser/nav-contract.mjs products.html   # 21 assertions
node tests/browser/a11y-contract.mjs pricing.html aegis.html sentinel.html
```

Browser tests must append `?skipboot=1` — the site's documented bypass for the
first-visit boot loader. Without it the harness measures `/loader.html` instead
of the page under test.

CI enforcement rides on the existing `CI / Python Tests` job: because
`tests/test_design_system.py` lives in `tests/`, `pytest tests/` fails the build
if any route drifts out of the system.

## Known gaps (not fixed here)

| Issue | Severity | Scope | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 39 root pages have no `<main>` landmark | Medium | `pricing.html`, `aegis.html`, `sentinel.html`, `government.html`, … | The bypass link resolves a target regardless, so WCAG 2.4.1 is met. `cg-a11y.js` deliberately does **not** fake `role="main"` — the block holding the `<h1>` is often just the hero, and mislabelling a partial region is worse than the missing role. Needs markup edits per page. |
| Two navigation systems coexist | Medium | 35 `control-surface.js` pages vs 108 `nav.js` pages | The keyboard contract is now unified via `cg-a11y.js`; the *visual* chrome still differs. Consolidating is a larger product decision. |
| `index.html` has two `role="banner"` elements | Low | homepage | The classification-style strip and the header both claim the banner landmark. |
| Large inline `<style>` blocks | Low | `clearglass-nexus.html` (79 KB), `guardian.html` (74 KB), `index.html` (71 KB) | Not regressed by this work; extracting them is a separate performance pass. |
| `unpkg.com` third-party scripts | Low | 2 pages (maplibre-gl) | Pre-existing external dependency. |

## Rollback

Every change is additive and reversible.

```bash
# Full rollback of this branch
git revert <merge-commit>            # or: git checkout main -- .

# Roll back only the injected asset links / metadata, keeping the tooling
git checkout main -- '*.html' 'blog/*.html' 'offers/*.html' 'products/**/*.html'

# Roll back only the navigation accessibility work
git checkout main -- nav.js
rm cg-a11y.js
```

Removing `cg-a11y.js` from disk degrades gracefully: pages still load, the
`<script>` tag 404s, and the site returns to its previous behaviour. Removing
the `<script>` tags themselves is what `git checkout main -- '*.html'` does.

## Adding a page

1. Author the page with a `<main>` element and a single `<h1>`.
2. Add it to `PAGES` and a cluster in `tools/internal_links.py`, then run it.
3. Run `python3 tools/design_system.py` — it links the design system, the nav,
   the keyboard contract, and derives the social card.
4. Add the URL to `sitemap.xml`.
5. If the page must opt out, add it to `EXEMPT`/`NAV_EXEMPT` **with a reason** —
   a test enforces that.
