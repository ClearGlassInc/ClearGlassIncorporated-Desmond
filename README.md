ClearGlassInc Artemis is an engineering monorepo and live product surface for secure automation, defensive intelligence, governed commerce, and high-assurance agent systems. It turns fragmented data and workflows into auditable decision support—without allowing model output to manufacture authority.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **See the system, then inspect the evidence.** Visit the [live ClearGlassInc experience](https://www.clearglassinc.com/), explore the implementation map below, and star the repository if governed agentic systems belong in your technical radar.

## Why this matters

Most AI demonstrations optimize for fluent output. Mission-critical systems must optimize for **traceable evidence, bounded authority, reversible deployment, and measurable operator trust**. Artemis treats AI output as untrusted until deterministic policy checks and, where required, explicit human approval make the next transition valid.

### What makes Artemis different

| Ordinary AI project | ClearGlassInc Artemis |
| --- | --- |
| Chat interface as the product | Ontology, policy, agents, approval, audit, and deployment as one system |
| Model confidence as authority | Evidence lineage and deterministic authorization outside the model |
| Autonomous action by default | Read-only analysis → draft → human approval → governed execution |
| Architecture claims without boundaries | Implemented components are separated from clearly labeled target-state blueprints |
| One-shot launch | Operational docs, tests, security gates, and an evolving product surface |

## Platform highlights

- **Governed agent workflows** — typed tools, risk-scored transitions, approval queues, and append-only material-action records.
- **Full-stack intelligence design** — operator interfaces, Python services, ontology contracts, retrieval, event processing, and model routing.
- **Palantir-aligned blueprint** — precise roles for Gotham, Foundry, AIP, and Apollo without implying unverified provisioning.
- **Secure-by-construction controls** — need-to-know access, zero-trust boundaries, provenance, rollback, and policy-as-code.
- **Production delivery surfaces** — GitHub Pages, containerized services, CI gates, health checks, and independently deployable applications.

## Local static-site run

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

## Python tooling

The Python packages and bots target Python 3.11+ unless a package-specific README says otherwise. The root pytest configuration now includes the major Python test roots.

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .[test]
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q
```

## Frontend tooling

Each Next.js app is intentionally self-contained. Install dependencies in the app directory before building.

```bash
cd clearglass-commerce/storefront && npm ci && npm run build
cd ../admin && npm ci && npm run build
cd ../../apps/autostore/cockpit && npm ci && npm run build
```

## Stripe product-catalogue sync

`scripts/sync-stripe-products.ts` reads the products published on the GitHub
Pages site and creates or updates the matching Stripe Products and Prices. It
reads structured data only — it never scrapes rendered HTML for a price — and it
is idempotent: running it ten times produces the same one Stripe Product per SKU.

**Every run is a dry run until you pass `--apply`.** Nothing is ever deleted.

### Product sources and their schemas

| `--source` | File | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `side-store` | `side-store.html` | `<script id="catalog" type="application/json">` — the same JSON island the page itself renders |
| `store` | `data/store/catalog.json` | Generated from `store.html` by `scripts/store_sync.py` |
| `pricebook` | `clearglass-commerce/control-plane/app/data/pricebook.json` | Commerce control-plane price book — **opt-in**, see below |

Default is `side-store,store` (everything on Pages). `--source all` adds the
price book. A `side-store` entry looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "sku_001",
  "sku": "USB-C-C-1M",
  "name": "USB-C to USB-C Cable 1m",
  "category": "USB Cables",
  "price": 6.99,
  "description": "60W fast-charge, braided."
}
```

`sku` and `name` are required. `price` is major units (dollars) and is converted
to integer cents on the decimal string, not by multiplying a float. `image` or
`images` are optional; relative paths resolve against the Pages base URL.
`data/store/catalog.json` differs in one way that matters: its `amount_cents`
is already in minor units, and its `price_display` copy is what decides whether
the amount is exact or quote-driven.

The price book is opt-in because its offers already name Stripe Prices in the
**live** account. Those ids mean nothing against a test key, so the sync verifies
any source-supplied id against the target account before reusing it and falls
back to creating a fresh record when it does not resolve.

### How the mapping works

| Source | Stripe |
|---|---|
| `<adapter>:<sku>` | `product.metadata.source_id` — the stable external identifier |
| Page URL of the listing | `product.metadata.source_url` |
| `owner/repo` | `product.metadata.source_repository` |
| sha256 of the normalised product | `product.metadata.source_hash` — drives update-vs-no-op |
| `name`, `description`, `images` | Product `name`, `description`, `images` |
| `category`, inventory status | `product.metadata.source_category`, `.inventory_status` |
| One variant | One Price, tagged `price.metadata.variant_key` |
| `price` / `amount_cents` | `unit_amount`, integer minor units |
| Billing interval, where the source states one | `price.recurring` |

Everything this tool creates carries `metadata.managed_by = clearglass-site-sync`.
Stripe records without that marker are never touched, adopted, or reported.

Lookup is by `source_id` over a full paginated `products.list`, not
`products.search`: the search index is eventually consistent, and a stale miss
there would create a duplicate. Creates additionally carry a content-derived
idempotency key, so a run that dies mid-flight and is retried reuses the
original object rather than minting a second one.

### Prices change by addition, never mutation

A Stripe Price is immutable in amount and currency. When a listed price changes,
the sync creates a **new** Price and leaves the old one active — existing
subscriptions keep billing against it. Pass `--deactivate-old-prices` to retire
the superseded Price once you have confirmed nothing references it; without the
flag, the plan still lists it so you can see what was left behind.

A product removed from the site produces an `orphan-warning` row. It is never
archived or deleted automatically — archive it in the Stripe Dashboard if that
is what you want.

### Running it locally

```bash
npm ci

# Review the mapping with no credential and no network at all:
npm run sync:stripe -- --source all --offline

# Dry run against your Stripe test account (reads Stripe, writes nothing):
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
npm run sync:stripe

# Write to Stripe test mode:
npm run sync:stripe -- --apply

# One source, and retire superseded prices:
npm run sync:stripe -- --source side-store --apply --deactivate-old-prices

npm test          # offline, fully mocked — no Stripe credential required
npm run typecheck
```

Options: `--source`, `--apply`, `--live`, `--deactivate-old-prices`,
`--offline`, `--check-images`, `--base-url`, `--repository`, `--currency`,
`--report`, `--json`, `--help`. Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` a product failed or
needs manual correction, `2` refused for a configuration or safety reason.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | for anything that reaches Stripe | Read from the environment only. Never commit it, never put it in client-side JS. |
| `ALLOW_STRIPE_LIVE_SYNC` | only for `--live` | Must be exactly `true`. |
| `SITE_BASE_URL` | no | Pages origin. Defaults to `https://www.clearglassinc.com`. |
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | no | Written to `source_repository` metadata. |

`typescript` and `tsx` sit in `dependencies` rather than `devDependencies` on
purpose: `clearglassinc-military-op.yml` runs `npm ci` with `NODE_ENV=production`,
which omits dev dependencies, and the type check and tests must still run there.

### Test mode versus live mode

Test mode is the default and needs nothing but an `sk_test_…` key. Live mode
requires **three independent signals to agree**, and any two without the third
is a refusal:

1. `--live` on the command line,
2. `ALLOW_STRIPE_LIVE_SYNC=true` in the environment,
3. a genuinely live (`sk_live_…` / `rk_live_…`) secret key.

A live key with no `--live` is also refused, so a mis-filed secret cannot quietly
write to production. In CI there is a fourth gate: the live job is bound to the
`stripe-live` environment and reads a separate `STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY` secret.

### Running it from GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/sync-stripe-products.yml` runs on `workflow_dispatch` with
`apply` (default `false`) and `live` (default `false`) inputs, plus `sources` and
`deactivate_old_prices`. It installs with `npm ci`, runs the type check and the
test suite **before** any sync job, and uploads the JSON report as a workflow
artifact. It also runs automatically after a successful `Deploy Pages` run — as a
dry-run drift check, which cannot write because `workflow_run` carries no inputs.

To add the credential: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New
repository secret**, named `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, holding your `sk_test_…` key.
For live sync, add `STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY` as a secret **on the `stripe-live`
environment** (Settings → Environments), and add a repository *variable*
`ALLOW_STRIPE_LIVE_SYNC` set to `true`. Keeping the opt-in in a variable rather
than an input means turning live sync on is a separate, auditable act from
requesting a run.

The secret is never interpolated into a `run:` script, never printed, and never
reaches the report. Any key-shaped string in an error message is redacted before
it is logged.

### Recovering from a failed sync

The script is safe to re-run: that is the recovery procedure. A failure on one
product is recorded and the rest of the catalogue continues, so a partial run
leaves a consistent Stripe account, not a half-written one.

1. Read `stripe-sync-report.json` (the workflow artifact) — `failures` names
   what broke and `manual_correction_required` names what was withheld.
2. Fix the source data, or the Stripe-side cause.
3. Re-run the dry run and confirm the plan says what you expect.
4. Re-run with `--apply`. Content-derived idempotency keys mean products that
   already synced are not duplicated; they show as `product-unchanged`.

If the plan reports `several Stripe products claim this source_id`, the sync
refuses to apply until you merge them by hand in the Dashboard — it will not
guess which record is the real one. Nothing in this tool deletes a Stripe object,
so a bad run is always recoverable by editing the source and syncing again.

### Products that currently need manual correction

Three engagements in `data/store/catalog.json` are withheld because their listed
price is a floor rather than an amount: `hardening` ("from CAD $2,500"), `phipa`
("from CAD $3,000") and `monitoring` ("from CAD $600 / month"). A Stripe Price
needs one exact number. Give each a fixed amount in `store.html` and re-run
`python scripts/store_sync.py --write`, or leave them as quote-driven
engagements outside Stripe.

## Continuous integration

Workflows in `.github/workflows/` cover the active CI/CD paths, including:

- `ci.yml` — Python tests, Ruff lint, site reliability audit, workflow doctor, and OSINT deck validation.
- `sync-stripe-products.yml` — manual Stripe catalogue sync (dry run by default) plus a post-deploy drift check.
- `pages.yml` — GitHub Pages deployment for the static site.
- `commerce-frontend-ci.yml` and `commerce-deploy.yml` — commerce frontend validation and deployment.
- `auto-store.yml` — Autostore validation/deployment path.
- `security.yml`, `api-security-audit.yml`, `policy-gate.yml`, `release-supply-chain.yml`, and `ip-protection-scan.yml` — security, policy, and supply-chain checks.
- Scheduled automation workflows such as `bot-orchestrator.yml`, `content-pipeline.yml`, `control-surface-feeds.yml`, `defender-watch.yml`, and `health-monitor.yml`.

## ClearGlass Growth Entity

Run the local manual-review growth command system with PowerShell 7:

```powershell
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\ClearGlass-GrowthEntity.ps1 -Mode Sample -OpenFolder
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\ClearGlass-GrowthEntity.ps1 -Mode Full -OpenFolder
```

The script creates `ClearGlassGrowthEntity/` with configuration, content scoring exports,
daily posting briefs, finance action files, and logs. It is intentionally a planning and
compliance-review system only; do not store passwords, tokens, cookies, or API secrets in it,
and do not use it for fake engagement, mass DMs, scraping, or platform-bypass behavior.

## Threads Growth Command Center V3

Run the Python-first, compliant Threads growth command center locally:

```bash
python -m bots.threads_growth_command_center --mode all --brand-name ClearGlassInc --root-path ./ThreadsGrowthCommandCenter_V3
python -m bots.threads_growth_command_center --mode add-kpi --root-path ./ThreadsGrowthCommandCenter_V3 --followers 100 --posts 3 --replies 40 --likes 80 --reposts 10 --impressions 1000 --profile-visits 25 --notes "Manual daily closeout"
```

The system creates a 30-day content calendar, daily manual execution brief,
copy-editing draft files, KPI tracker, engagement tracker, backups, and a
self-contained HTML dashboard. It is intentionally a planning, drafting, and
measurement system only: zero botting, zero scraping, no automated follows,
likes, comments, reposts, DMs, or storage of platform cookies/session tokens.
