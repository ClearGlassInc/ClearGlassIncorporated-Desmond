## Guardian Digital Presence Protection Program

Guardian now includes a protection-first Digital Presence Protection Program governed by ARTEMIS and the AEGIS lifecycle:

```text
OBSERVE → DETECT → ANALYSE → VERIFY → RESPOND → AUDIT → IMPROVE
```

The program monitors authorized public-facing surfaces including websites, domains/subdomains, business listings, social profiles, search surfaces, directories, GitHub identities, public references, reviews, and public-source mentions.

Protection priorities are:

- Brand and impersonation protection
- Reputation assurance
- Digital-asset integrity
- Geo-Grid Visibility Assurance rather than rank-only optimization
- Compliance-control monitoring
- Evidence provenance and auditability
- Defensible incident coordination

Implementation artifacts:

- `docs/GUARDIAN_DPPP.md` — full operating and security control specification
- `config/guardian/dppp.json` — machine-readable fail-closed policy contract
- `scripts/validate_guardian_dppp.py` — dependency-free policy validator and SHA-256 evidence generator

The validator must pass before the DPPP policy is considered structurally valid:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_guardian_dppp.py
```

Guardian DPPP uses dual classification for findings: **severity** (`INFORMATIONAL` through `CRITICAL`) and **epistemic status** (`VERIFIED FACT`, `INFERENCE`, `ASSUMPTION`, `UNKNOWN`, `UNVERIFIED`). Significant findings require source identification, timestamps, evidence digesting, verification state, confidence, and provenance. Unsupported claims remain `UNVERIFIED`.

External-impact actions remain human-authorized by policy. Missing authorization, integrity failures, expired authorization, schema failures, and emergency-stop conditions fail closed. The repository makes no claim of NSA certification or equivalence; “high-assurance” describes the intended engineering discipline rather than a government accreditation.

## Governed Data Fabric

Repository-backed operational data is cataloged through `data/catalog.json` and accessed through `assets/js/clearglass-data-fabric.js`.

The fabric provides:

- same-origin loading
- parent-traversal blocking
- JSON and CSV decoding
- module and root-dataset discovery
- browser health checks
- restricted browser access for sensitive workflow boundaries such as `data/leads`

Run the offline validator when a local checkout is available:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_data_fabric.py
node --check assets/js/clearglass-data-fabric.js
```

## Actions-Independent Release Path

GitHub Pages is configured from `main` and can publish through the repository's legacy Pages build path. The site also includes browser-based data-fabric diagnostics so the public runtime can be checked without depending on a GitHub-hosted Actions runner.

See `docs/ACTIONS_BILLING_FALLBACK.md` for the operational fallback and recovery procedure.

## Secure CircleCI Orchestration

`.circleci/config.yml` is the guarded CircleCI 2.1 orchestration entry point for repository validation, GitHub-workflow validation, frontend/animation artifact builds, sandbox agent checks, and approved Fly.io releases of the ClearGlass agent service.

### Workflows

- **`validate`** is the default branch/pull-request path. It runs preflight, dependency verification, lint/type/test/build, dependency and secret scans, GitHub workflow validation, frontend/animation smoke tests, and sandbox agent contract tests. It performs no deployment or GitHub mutation.
- **`staging_release`** exists only when the manually supplied pipeline parameter `deploy_staging=true`. Preflight additionally requires `run_validation=true`, `target_environment=staging`, `emergency_stop=false`, and a branch ref. All validation/security jobs must pass before the `staging-deploy` context is available to the deployment job.
- **`production_release`** exists only when the manually supplied pipeline parameter `deploy_production=true`. Preflight additionally requires `run_validation=true`, `target_environment=production`, `emergency_stop=false`, and either the protected `main` branch or a trusted signed `v...` release tag. A CircleCI `hold_production` approval job must be approved before the `production-deploy` context can be used.

### Manual pipeline parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `run_validation` | boolean | `true` | Run the validation chain. Required for either deployment. |
| `run_github_automation_checks` | boolean | `false` | Add extended, read-only GitHub workflow checks. Never triggers or writes GitHub Actions. |
| `run_agent_health_checks` | boolean | `false` | Add extended local/sandbox agent HTTP contract checks. |
| `deploy_staging` | boolean | `false` | Request a staging release. Requires `target_environment=staging`. |
| `deploy_production` | boolean | `false` | Request a production release. Requires `target_environment=production` and approval. |
| `enable_agents` | boolean | `false` | Reserved for a separately reviewed activation adapter. Currently fails closed if set `true`. |
| `deploy_animations` | boolean | `false` | Reserved for a separately reviewed frontend publication adapter. Currently fails closed if set `true`. |
| `emergency_stop` | boolean | `false` | Global mutation stop. If `true`, every deployment/activation/publication request is rejected. |
| `target_environment` | enum | `none` | One of `none`, `staging`, or `production`. |

Trigger release pipelines from CircleCI's manual pipeline trigger surface and supply only the parameters needed for that release. Do not place secret values in pipeline parameters.

### Required restricted contexts

Create and restrict these CircleCI contexts before enabling release workflows:

**`ci-readonly`**

- Must not contain a GitHub write token, deploy token, or other repository-mutation credential.
- For signed production tag verification, set `TRUSTED_RELEASE_SIGNER_FINGERPRINT` and `TRUSTED_RELEASE_SIGNER_PUBLIC_KEY_B64` to the reviewed release-signing public identity. These values are verification material, not private signing credentials.

**`staging-deploy`**

- `FLY_API_TOKEN` — staging-scoped Fly.io credential.
- `FLYCTL_VERSION` — exact approved Fly CLI version; `latest` is rejected.
- `STAGING_FLY_APP=REPLACE_ME` — dedicated staging Fly.io app. Do not point this at the production app.
- `STAGING_HEALTH_URL` — optional explicit staging health endpoint; defaults to the selected Fly app `/health` endpoint.

**`production-deploy`**

- `FLY_API_TOKEN` — production-scoped Fly.io credential.
- `FLYCTL_VERSION` — exact approved Fly CLI version; `latest` is rejected.
- `PRODUCTION_FLY_APP` — optional; defaults to the repository's existing `clearglass-agent-service` app.
- `PRODUCTION_HEALTH_URL` — optional explicit health endpoint.

Restrict the staging and production contexts to the appropriate CircleCI security groups/project controls. Production credentials must never be copied into `ci-readonly`.

### GitHub automation boundary

CircleCI validates `.github/workflows/**`, YAML syntax, repository workflow governance, and immutable action pinning. It does **not** trigger, rerun, unblock, cancel, approve, or modify GitHub Actions and it does not auto-merge pull requests. Any future GitHub write integration requires a separately approved GitHub App/token scope, a new explicit pipeline parameter defaulting to `false`, and an independent review of the affected repository rules and environments.

### Frontend animations and agents

The frontend/animation job builds deterministic assets, syntax-checks browser JavaScript, runs a local static smoke test, and stores a commit-addressed archive plus SHA-256 evidence. It does not publish the site.

`deploy_animations=true` is intentionally rejected until `REPLACE_ME_ANIMATION_DEPLOY_ADAPTER` is replaced with a reviewed deployment path that does not bypass GitHub Pages/repository protections.

The agent job imports and tests the FastAPI service locally, verifies `/health`, OpenAPI schema availability, authenticated/unauthenticated permission boundaries, and extended sandbox behavior when requested. Autonomous activation is not performed.

`enable_agents=true` is intentionally rejected until `REPLACE_ME_AGENT_ACTIVATION_ADAPTER` and an enforceable runtime rate-limit policy are implemented and reviewed.

### Dependency and secret gates

- Node uses `npm ci` with the committed `package-lock.json`.
- The deployed agent service requires exact `==` pins in `services/clearglass_agent_service/requirements.txt`.
- Root Python validation follows the repository's existing `requirements.txt` constraint plus `pyproject.toml` test-extra installation contract; the pipeline records SHA-256 hashes of dependency inputs for evidence.
- `npm audit` high/critical findings and all `pip-audit` findings block deployment unless the exact advisory identifier is reviewed in `scripts/ci/security-allowlist.txt`.
- Changed text/code files are scanned with `detect-secrets`; any candidate fails closed and must be investigated rather than silently suppressed in CI.

### Immutable deployment and evidence

Fly releases use a commit-addressed image tag (`sha-$CIRCLE_SHA1`) and resolve it to a registry digest before deployment. A previously created commit image is reused rather than overwritten. Before mutation, the pipeline records the currently deployed image so rollback is possible. Deployment evidence is stored under `deploy-evidence/` as CircleCI artifacts.

Post-deploy verification requires:

1. the running Fly image to resolve to the digest recorded by the pipeline;
2. 20/20 successful `/health` requests (synthetic error-rate guardrail of 0%);
3. the protected `/policy` endpoint to fail closed when called without credentials; and
4. for production, the public ClearGlass homepage to return HTTP 200 and expected brand content.

A deployment is not considered successful until these checks pass.

### Rollback procedure

**Staging:** deployment or post-deploy verification failure automatically redeploys the previously recorded immutable image and verifies `/health`. The rollback result is written to the deployment evidence.

**Production:** post-deploy failure does not silently mutate production again. CircleCI records the exact rollback command and prior image in the production deployment artifacts. After incident review and approval, run the same release workspace with the `production-deploy` context and execute:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/fly_rollback.sh production
```

The script reads `deploy-evidence/production-previous-image.txt`, redeploys that exact image, verifies `/health`, and records the rollback result. Do not substitute an unreviewed tag or `latest` image.

No rollback procedure rotates secrets, changes repository permissions, alters organization settings, deletes data, or bypasses a protected environment.

## Repository Safety

- No credentials or private API keys belong in source control.
- Production secrets must remain in approved external secret stores or platform configuration.
- Public OSINT and cybersecurity functions are defensive, lawful, and evidence-oriented.
- Counter-UAS material in this repository is a component/research area; it is **not** the identity or primary purpose of this repository.
