"""Agent capability vocabulary and scope loader.

Every ``agents/*/agent.json`` declares a ``permissions`` list. Until now those
declarations were **documentation only** — nothing in the repo read them (see
``operations/architect-checklist/2026-W31.md``, item 3). This module is the first
half of closing that gap: one importable source of truth for what a capability
token may be, so the eventual governance wiring and the CI gate agree on the
vocabulary instead of drifting apart.

It deliberately does **not** enforce anything at runtime yet. Mapping these
tokens onto ``clearglass-commerce/control-plane/app/governance.py`` action names
— so that an undeclared or unrecognised capability inherits that module's
fail-closed "unknown action ⇒ high risk" behaviour — is a separate change that
was flagged for cross-team review before implementation. Declaring the
vocabulary is safe; silently changing what agents are allowed to do is not.

Stdlib only, per the repo convention for governance-adjacent modules.
