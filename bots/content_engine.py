ClearGlassInc Content Engine

Daily content pipeline: selects a brand pillar, generates platform-specific
copy for LinkedIn, Threads, X, email, and website updates, then writes
structured output for downstream validation, scheduling, and publishing.

Pillar rotation: daily (day-of-year % 4).
Variant rotation: weekly (ISO week % num_variants) — prevents repetition.
