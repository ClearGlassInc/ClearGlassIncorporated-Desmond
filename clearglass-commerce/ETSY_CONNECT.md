# Connecting the Etsy shop

The control plane's Etsy surface (`app/etsy.py`, `app/routers/etsy.py`) can detect a
connection, verify it read-only, and gate every write behind human approval. What it
cannot do is *create* the connection: only Etsy can mint an access token, and only after
the shop owner approves the requested scopes in a browser. This document is that step.

Target account: **https://www.etsy.com/people/7is7jsngx568dcve** (`ETSY_PROFILE_URL`).

> A profile URL is not a credential. Etsy publishes no API that resolves a `/people/`
> handle to a shop or a token, so the URL is stored declaratively and echoed on
> `GET /etsy/connection` — it documents *which* account should be on the other end of the
> handshake, and the operator eyeballs it against the shop the token actually resolves to.

## 1. Create the Etsy app (once)

Register at <https://www.etsy.com/developers/your-apps> as the shop owner.

- Copy the **keystring** → `ETSY_KEYSTRING` (and the shared secret → `ETSY_SHARED_SECRET`).
- Register a **callback URL** and set the identical string as `ETSY_REDIRECT_URI`.
  Etsy compares it byte for byte; a trailing slash mismatch fails the exchange.
- Etsy app approval is required before the API returns live shop data.

## 2. Run the handshake

```bash
cd clearglass-commerce/control-plane
python -m app.etsy_connect --status     # what is configured, what is still missing
python -m app.etsy_connect              # the consent flow
```

The CLI prints a consent URL, you open it as the shop owner and approve, Etsy redirects
to `ETSY_REDIRECT_URI` with a `code`, and you paste that redirect URL back. It uses
OAuth2 **PKCE**, so the shared secret is never transmitted and an intercepted code is
useless without the one-time verifier held in the CLI process.

Check that the `state` on the redirect matches the one the CLI printed. If it doesn't,
abandon the flow — the response didn't originate from your request.

Requested scopes are exactly what the operator needs, no more:

| Scope | Why |
|-------|-----|
| `listings_r` / `listings_w` | read the catalog; publish approved listings |
| `transactions_r` / `transactions_w` | read receipts; act on approved order changes |

Split across machines (browser on one, shell on another) with the verifier the CLI prints:

```bash
python -m app.etsy_connect --exchange --code '<redirect URL or code>' --verifier '<verifier>'
```

## 3. Store the tokens as runtime secrets

The CLI prints `ETSY_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `ETSY_REFRESH_TOKEN` and `ETSY_SCOPES`. Put them in
the runtime secret store (Render env group, GitHub Actions secret, an uncommitted local
`.env`) — **never** in a committed file. Nothing in this flow writes a secret to disk.

Access tokens lapse after about an hour; refresh tokens last far longer:

```bash
python -m app.etsy_connect --refresh
```

## 4. Verify

```bash
curl -sX POST localhost:8000/etsy/verify -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

Read-only. Confirms shop identity, that listing and order permissions were granted, and
reads back listing counts as sync status; the check itself is logged to the audit ledger.
`verified: true` means the connection is live.

## What connecting does *not* unlock

Connecting grants no autonomy. Every write to the live shop —
`etsy_publish_listing`, `etsy_update_listing`, `etsy_sync_inventory`, `etsy_manage_order` —
is in `ALWAYS_ESCALATE` and scores HIGH, so the routes can only ever *queue* an approval:
they pass `execute=None` and nothing runs inline. Before connection they fail earlier
still, with `blocked_not_connected`. Publishing anything to the shop remains a deliberate
human decision recorded in the ledger.
