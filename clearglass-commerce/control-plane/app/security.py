"""Admin authentication for governed / administrative endpoints.

The approval gate in :mod:`app.governance` is the heart of the safety model — but a
gate is only meaningful if not everyone can open it. Before this module, every
mutating admin endpoint (approve/reject, live pricing, refunds, catalog writes) was
reachable by anyone who could hit the API, and ``decided_by`` was a self-asserted
string. This closes that hole without changing the governance logic.

Behaviour mirrors the rest of the platform's fail-closed / mock-mode philosophy:

* **No key configured** → the API runs in *open* dev / mock mode (same spirit as
  running payments in mock mode with no Stripe key). Local dev and the test suite
  work unchanged.
* **``app_env == "production"`` with no key** → the app **fails closed at startup**
  (mirrors governance defaulting unknown actions to high risk). A production control
  plane must never boot wide open.
* **Key configured** → protected endpoints require ``Authorization: Bearer <key>``,
  compared in constant time. Multiple comma-separated keys are accepted so operators
  can rotate credentials without downtime.

The module is deliberately dependency-light (stdlib + fastapi) so it stays cheap to
test and reason about.
