# ClearGlass Inc — Full-Spectrum Search Visibility Strategy

**Property:** `https://www.clearglassinc.com` (GitHub Pages, served static via `.nojekyll`)
**Entity:** Desmond Otieno Odhiambo — Founder & Software Architect
**Positioning:** Enterprise cybersecurity · AI automation · autonomous agents · OSINT · digital investigations · financial-crime analysis
**Prepared:** 2026-06-18

> This document is the source of truth for SEO/GEO work on this repo. It pairs with the technical fixes already committed on branch `claude/github-seo-strategy-npwm5l` (loader crawler-guard, consolidated JSON-LD with a `Person` entity, `ProfessionalService` schema, fixed `README.md` fence, corrected meta description).

## 1. Executive Summary

ClearGlass already has the hard parts most GitHub Pages sites skip: a sitemap (64 URLs), `robots.txt`, security headers (`_headers`), a PWA manifest, inline JSON-LD, and Bing/Google verification files. The site is **not under-built — it is under-disciplined**. The ranking ceiling today is set by four things:

1. **Crawlability risk (highest severity).** The homepage `<head>` ran *two* client-side `window.location.replace()` redirects to cinematic loader pages (`cg-loader.html`, `loader.html`) on cold visits. A search/AI crawler hitting `/` with no cookie/referrer would be bounced into an interstitial — risking the loader being indexed instead of the real page, and tanking LCP. **Fixed** in this branch by adding a crawler user-agent guard, but the loader pattern should be retired on indexable pages entirely (see §3/§4).
2. **Weak entity grounding for the person.** The brand is a personal-authority play ("Founder & Software Architect"), but structured data described only an `Organization`/`LocalBusiness`. **Fixed** by adding a `Person` entity (Desmond) wired via `founder`/`worksFor`, plus `knowsAbout` topics and `sameAs`. This is the #1 lever for AI-search citation and Knowledge-Panel eligibility.
3. **Topical sprawl.** ~80 top-level HTML pages (Artemis IV/VI, Percival, Guardian, Sentinel, Conduit, Nexus, Avalon…) with overlapping names and no clear silo hierarchy. Crawl budget and link equity are diluted across near-duplicate product surfaces. The fastest gains come from **consolidating into silos** and making each page about exactly one topic.
4. **Backlink/authority vacuum.** A `github.io` subdomain inherits some of github.com's trust but builds none of its own. There is effectively no off-site citation graph yet. Authority work (LinkedIn, dev.to, GitHub org profile, digital PR) is the long-pole for competitive head terms.

**The fastest path to ranking gains, in order:** (1) kill crawler interstitials → (2) ship per-page titles/descriptions/canonicals + `Person`/`Service` schema → (3) collapse to clean silos with internal linking → (4) publish 3–5 authoritative cornerstone articles → (5) build the off-site citation graph.

## 2. Prioritized Action Plan (highest ranking impact first)

| # | Action | Impact | Effort | Status |
|---|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| P0 | Stop redirecting crawlers off the homepage/loader pages | 🔴 Critical | Done | ✅ committed (UA guard); **recommend full removal on indexable pages** |
| P0 | Add `Person` + `ProfessionalService` JSON-LD, link via `@id` graph | 🔴 Critical | Done | ✅ committed |
| P0 | Fix `README.md` unclosed code fence (everything below rendered as code) | 🟠 High | Done | ✅ committed |
| P0 | Complete truncated homepage meta description (`…`) | 🟠 High | Done | ✅ committed |
| P1 | Create the **GitHub org profile README** (separate `.github` repo) | 🔴 Critical | 1h | ⬜ see §3 (template provided) |
| P1 | Unique `<title>` + `<meta description>` + `<link canonical>` + OG/Twitter per page | 🔴 Critical | 1–2 days | ⬜ |
| P1 | Define silos + add breadcrumb nav + `BreadcrumbList` schema | 🟠 High | 1 day | ⬜ |
| P1 | Optimize `og:image` (currently a 2.8 MB iOS screenshot PNG; `.webp` already exists) | 🟠 High | 1h | ⬜ |

## 3. Current Visibility Audit (findings, grounded in the repo)

| Area | Finding | Fix |
|------|---------|-----|
| **GitHub Pages setup** | `.nojekyll` present, served from `main`; `_headers`/`_redirects`/`netlify.toml`/`render.yaml`/`fly.toml` all present — multi-host config is fine but `_headers`/`_redirects` are **Netlify/Cloudflare-only and ignored by GitHub Pages**. Don't rely on them for prod headers. | Treat GitHub Pages as the source of truth; replicate critical headers via `<meta>` where possible, or move to Cloudflare Pages if header control matters. |
| **Crawlability** | Two JS redirects to loaders fired on cold visits. | ✅ Guarded for bots; retire loaders on indexable routes. |
| **Profile SEO** | No GitHub **org** profile README exists (`.github/profile/README.md` lives in a repo literally named `.github`, not this repo). | Create it — template in this section. |
| **Repository naming** | Product names (Artemis, Percival, Guardian…) are brand-evocative but not keyword-bearing. | Keep brand names; add keyword-rich repo **descriptions** + topics. |
| **README structure** | Unclosed ```` ``` ```` fence + duplicated `# ClearGlassInc.` heading → body rendered as one code block. | ✅ Fixed. |
| **Metadata** | Homepage description truncated with `…`; many product pages likely share/lack unique titles. | ✅ Homepage fixed; audit all pages (§4 tooling). |
| **Internal linking** | `nav.js`/footer provide nav, but no breadcrumb trail or silo structure; orphan-risk for deep product pages. | Add breadcrumbs + hub→spoke links. |
| **External backlinks** | Effectively none beyond github.com. | §6 program. |
| **Page speed / CWV** | Homepage ships large inline CSS + Google Fonts + heavy hero imagery; loader redirect added a full extra navigation. og:image is 2.8 MB. | Self-host/`font-display:swap` (already `&display=swap` ✅), preload hero, serve `.webp`, drop loader. |
| **Mobile usability** | `viewport` meta present with `viewport-fit=cover` ✅. | Verify tap targets/CLS via Lighthouse mobile. |
| **Structured data** | Was Org + LocalBusiness only; `schema.json` was **orphaned** (standalone file crawlers never fetch) and **inconsistent** with inline JSON-LD. | ✅ Consolidated graph with `@id` refs; `schema.json` reconciled as the canonical template. |
| **Social previews** | OG/Twitter tags present ✅ but image is an unoptimized screenshot. | Ship a purpose-built 1200×630 OG card. |
| **AI readability** | Dense single-topic-per-page is weak; no FAQ blocks; content is design-heavy with little crawlable prose. | §7. |

### 3a. GitHub Org Profile README (create in a repo named `.github`)

> ⚠️ This file does **not** belong in `clearglassinc.github.io`. For an organization, the profile README must live at `ClearGlassInc/.github/profile/README.md`. Create that repo, then add:

```markdown

## 5. GitHub Optimization Plan

- **Profile README** → use §3a template (in the `.github` repo).
- **Pinned repositories** → pin the 6 that map to silos; rename-by-description, not by repo name.
- **Repo descriptions** (the searchable line): e.g. `Artemis — self-evolving autonomous AI security platform | zero-trust, multi-agent orchestration`.
- **Topics/tags** (set on each repo): `cybersecurity ai-automation autonomous-agents osint software-architecture zero-trust threat-detection llm fraud-detection`.
- **README headings** → one `# H1` per repo with the primary keyword; `## H2` sections matching search intent (Features, Architecture, Usage, Security).
- **Profile bio** → `Software Architect & Founder @ClearGlassInc · Cybersecurity · AI automation · OSINT · autonomous agents`.
- **Website link** → set to `https://www.clearglassinc.com` on profile + every flagship repo.
- **CONTRIBUTING/docs** → keep `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (all present ✅); add `docs/` index linking cornerstone content.
- **Commit/activity strategy** → consistent public commits build the contribution graph (a soft trust signal); ship the blog as markdown commits so each article is a public artifact.

## 6. Technical SEO Stack

| Job | Free / OSS | Premium / Enterprise | Automation-friendly (API) |
|-----|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Crawl & audit | Screaming Frog (free ≤500 URLs), Lighthouse CI | Sitebulb, Screaming Frog (paid), Ahrefs Site Audit | `lighthouse-ci`, Unlighthouse, Playwright |
| Log analysis | GoAccess | Splunk, Botify | GH Pages has no server logs → rely on GSC crawl stats |
| Backlinks | Google Search Console links report | Ahrefs, Semrush, Majestic | Ahrefs API, DataForSEO |
| Keyword research | Google Keyword Planner, Google Trends | Ahrefs, Semrush | DataForSEO, Keywords Everywhere API |
| Rank tracking | Manual SERP / GSC queries | SerpRobot, AccuRanker, Wincher | SerpApi, DataForSEO SERP API |
| Schema validation | [Schema.org validator](https://validator.schema.org), [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) | — | `structured-data-testing-tool` (npm) in CI |
| Performance | Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, WebPageTest | Calibre, SpeedCurve | PSI API, `lighthouse-ci` GitHub Action |
| Broken links | `lychee`, `linkinator` | Ahrefs | **Add `lychee` as a GitHub Action** (see §below) |
| Indexation | GSC Coverage, `site:` operator | Ahrefs, IndexNow | GSC API, **IndexNow API** (Bing/Yandex/DuckDuckGo) |
| AI search | Manual prompting (ChatGPT/Perplexity/Claude), Otterly.ai | Profound, Peec AI, Otterly.ai | Otterly/Profound APIs |

**Recommended CI additions (drop into `.github/workflows/`):**
```yaml
# seo-checks.yml — runs on PRs touching HTML
name: SEO checks
on: { pull_request: { paths: ["**/*.html", "sitemap.xml", "schema.json"] } }
jobs:
  links:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Broken link check
        uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@v2
        with: { args: "--no-progress './**/*.html'" }
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v12
        with:
          urls: |
            https://www.clearglassinc.com/
            https://www.clearglassinc.com/offers/
          uploadArtifacts: true
```

**IndexNow (instant indexation for Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, Brave):** generate a key, host `<key>.txt` at root, and ping on publish:
```bash
curl "https://api.indexnow.org/indexnow?url=https://www.clearglassinc.com/&key=YOUR_KEY"
```

## 7. Content Architecture (per-page targeting)

| Page | Primary keyword | Should rank for | Schema |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| `/` (home) | ClearGlass Inc (brand) | branded + "enterprise cybersecurity AI platform" | Organization, Person, WebSite, ProfessionalService ✅ |
| `/about/` | Desmond Otieno Odhiambo | "software architect cybersecurity", author authority | `Person` + `ProfilePage` |
| `/services/` | cybersecurity consulting | service head terms | `Service` / `OfferCatalog` |
| `/services/ai-automation` | AI automation services | "AI workflow automation", "autonomous agents for ops" | `Service` |
| `/services/osint-investigations` | OSINT services | "OSINT automation", "digital investigations" | `Service` |
| Case studies | "[industry] cybersecurity case study" | proof / E-E-A-T | `Article` + `CreativeWork` |
| Project/product pages | product name + category | "[product] zero trust platform" | `SoftwareApplication` |
| `/blog/*` | long-tail informational | featured snippets, AI citations | `Article` + `FAQPage` |
| `/resources/` (OSINT/security hub) | "OSINT tools list", "security resources" | link magnet | `ItemList` / `Collection` |
| `/contact/` | "contact ClearGlass" | branded | `ContactPage` |

**Rule:** one page = one primary keyword = one search intent. Today's overlapping Artemis/Percival/Nexus pages violate this; pick one canonical page per product and 301/`rel=canonical` the rest.

---

## 8. Authority & Backlink Plan

1. **LinkedIn** — Desmond posts 2–3×/week on cybersecurity/AI/OSINT; link to cornerstone articles. Optimize the profile headline with the same entity keywords as the `Person` schema (factual consistency feeds AI knowledge graphs).
2. **dev.to / Hashnode / Medium** — republish cornerstone articles with `rel=canonical` back to `www.clearglassinc.com/blog/...` (canonical keeps ranking on your domain, gains the referral link).
3. **GitHub** — Discussions on flagship repos; answer issues in adjacent OSS (OSINT/security tooling) with a profile link; get listed in `awesome-osint` / `awesome-security` lists.
4. **Substack newsletter** — "ClearGlass Intelligence Brief"; each issue links 2–3 site pages.
5. **Communities** — r/netsec, r/OSINT, OSINT Curious, MITRE/ATT&CK adjacent forums; contribute, don't spam.
6. **Citations & directories** — Clutch/GoodFirms (consulting), Crunchbase (entity), relevant Canadian/Ontario business listings (NAP consistency with the `LocalBusiness` address).
7. **Digital PR** — publish an original OSINT/fraud research report → pitch to security press for links.
8. **Partnerships / guest content** — co-author with complementary vendors; guest posts on established security blogs.

**Quality bar:** 5 relevant, topically-aligned links > 100 generic ones. Track via GSC links report monthly.

---

## 9. AI Search Optimization (GEO)

- **Semantic clarity** — lead each page with a 2–3 sentence plain-language summary of *what it is and who it's for*. AI engines extract these.
- **Entity association** — `Person`/`Organization`/`Service` graph with `@id` cross-refs is shipped ✅; keep `sameAs` (LinkedIn, GitHub, Crunchbase) consistent everywhere.
- **Factual consistency** — name, title, credentials, address, phone must match byte-for-byte across site, schema, LinkedIn, and directories.
- **Citation density** — cite primary sources (NIST, MITRE ATT&CK, FATF for financial crime); AI engines prefer pages that themselves cite authorities.
- **Structured formatting** — short paragraphs, descriptive `H2/H3`, tables, definition lists. (This document's format is the target shape.)
- **Chunkable content** — self-contained sections under clear headings, each answerable standalone.
- **FAQ optimization** — add `FAQPage` schema; example below.
- **Machine-readable signals** — clean semantic HTML, `lang`, canonical, sitemap `lastmod`, and an `llms.txt` at root.

**FAQ block (paste into services/product pages):**
```html
<section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/FAQPage">
  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h3 itemprop="name">What does ClearGlass Inc do?</h3>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <p itemprop="text">ClearGlass Inc builds enterprise cybersecurity platforms, AI
      automation, autonomous agents, and OSINT/investigative tooling, founded by
      software architect Desmond Otieno Odhiambo.</p>

## Appendix — What was changed in this branch

- `index.html`: crawler user-agent guard added to **both** loader redirects; consolidated two JSON-LD blocks into one `@graph` adding `Person` (Desmond), `ProfessionalService`, `ContactPoint`, and `@id` cross-references; completed truncated meta description.
- `schema.json`: reconciled to match the inline graph (was orphaned + inconsistent) so it can serve as the canonical schema template.
- `README.md`: closed the unterminated code fence and de-duplicated the heading so the repo page renders correctly.
- This document: `docs/SEO_STRATEGY.md`.
