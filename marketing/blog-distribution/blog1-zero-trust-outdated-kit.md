Zero Trust won its war. That's exactly the problem.

Fifteen years ago the dangerous actor was a stolen laptop on a flat network,
and "never trust, always verify" was the right revolution. It killed the
perimeter, mainstreamed MFA, made "assume breach" a board phrase.

But look at where losses actually come from now:

The MFA passed. The device was compliant. The session was valid. Then the
authenticated actor — a phished employee, a hijacked token, or an AI agent
with legitimate credentials — did something catastrophic it was technically
authorized to do.

Zero Trust has no answer, because Zero Trust interrogates the actor at the
door and then trusts every action inside the session. It moved the perimeter
from the network to the identity. It's still a perimeter.

AI agents finish the argument. A prompt-injected agent authenticates
flawlessly while executing an attacker's intent. One agent session contains
thousands of actions with thousands of separate purposes. Verifying the
identity once tells you nothing about action #7,412.

The unit of trust has to move from the identity to the action. We call the
replacement doctrine Adaptive Trust Systems:

1. ACTION TRUST — trust is scored per action, not per session. Reading a
   record and deleting ten thousand are different trust events.
2. INTENT VERIFICATION — authorized isn't aligned. Actions that don't serve
   the actor's declared purpose escalate, whatever the token allows.
3. LEARNING POLICY — policy consumes its own audit ledger. Clean track
   records widen autonomy; anomalies shrink it. Automatically.
4. TRUST ECONOMICS — trust is a budget. Irreversible actions are priced above
   any single actor's balance, so catastrophe structurally requires a
   co-signer.

It's how we handle every other dangerous capability: new drivers get
provisional licenses, junior traders get small books, nobody launches alone.

Security is the last discipline pretending a one-time identity check is a
theory of trust.

1/ Zero Trust is outdated.

Not wrong — outdated. It answered the question of its era, and the question
changed.

Here's the doctrine that replaces it. 🧵

2/ Zero Trust's era: stolen laptops, flat networks. "Never trust the network,
always verify the identity" was the right answer. It won.

Today's losses: the actor authenticates PERFECTLY, then does authorized
damage. Zero Trust has nothing to say about that.

3/ The flaw: Zero Trust interrogates the actor at the door, then trusts every
action inside the session.

It moved the perimeter from the network to the identity.

It's still a perimeter.

4/ AI agents end the debate:

• Prompt-injected agents authenticate flawlessly while executing an
  attacker's intent
• One session = thousands of actions with thousands of purposes
• Machine speed makes "residual risk" unsurvivable

The unit of trust must be the ACTION.

5/ Adaptive Trust Systems, 4 components:

ACTION TRUST — score the verb, not the noun
INTENT VERIFICATION — authorized ≠ aligned
LEARNING POLICY — track records widen autonomy, incidents shrink it
TRUST ECONOMICS — catastrophe priced above any single actor's budget

6/ The design rule:

If your policy can't tell the difference between an agent's first day and its
500th clean day, you don't have a trust system.

You have a permissions file.

7/ Keep Zero Trust as the floor. Build Adaptive Trust above it.

## Carousel headlines (7, Ontario-style)

1. Zero Trust verifies who you are, once. The damage happens after.
2. Your losses are post-authentication now. The doctrine isn't.
3. Identity was the right unit of trust — when actors were people.
4. Authorized isn't aligned. Intent is the check attackers can't hijack.
5. Trust is a budget you spend, a record you build, a price you pay.
6. First day vs. 500th clean day: can your policy tell the difference?
7. Keep Zero Trust as the floor. Build Adaptive Trust above it.
