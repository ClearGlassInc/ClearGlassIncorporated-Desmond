Route risky decisions to humans.\n4. Capture corrections.\n5. promote only workflows that survive evals.\n\nThat is how {pillar['keyword']} become a revenue engine instead of a board-level liability.\n\nIf your AI, OSINT, or legal automation stack cannot explain what it did, why it did it, and who approved it, it is not enterprise-grade yet.\n\nDownload the {pillar['offer']}: {url}"
