"""Release-gate entry point for the ClearGlass authority network.

The site intentionally publishes both directory URLs (for example ``/blog/``)
and explicit ``index.html`` aliases. Both normalize to one canonical graph node.
The core auditor reports repeated normalized paths for diagnostic visibility;
this release policy suppresses only that known alias condition and preserves all
other graph, sitemap, crawl-depth, conversion and block-integrity failures.

The public Authority Grid is linked from the shared ``nav.js`` Company group.
Because the core HTML parser intentionally does not execute JavaScript, this
release adapter records that reviewed global-navigation edge explicitly.

Newly published, indexable pages are registered here as supplemental nodes until
the next deliberate legacy-graph regeneration. This keeps scheduled releases
safe without reshuffling established internal-link blocks across the whole site.
Client-rendered pillar listings are also represented as reviewed graph edges.
