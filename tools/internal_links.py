"""ClearGlass internal-linking generator.

Injects a compact, self-styled "Continue exploring" block into every indexable
static page, turning the site into a deliberate pillar-and-cluster link network:

  - every page carries a breadcrumb to Home and to its topic pillar
  - every page links to a rotated window of cluster siblings, so inbound link
    equity is distributed across the whole cluster instead of pooling on the
    first few pages
  - curated cross-cluster links (EXTRA_LINKS) bridge related topics
  - every page ends with a two-link CTA path chosen per cluster

The block is static HTML (crawlable without JS execution), delimited by
`cg-related` marker comments, and regenerated in place — safe to re-run any
time the map below changes:

    python3 tools/internal_links.py          # rewrite blocks on all pages
    python3 tools/internal_links.py --check  # exit 1 if any page is stale

stdlib only. The site graph lives in PAGES / CLUSTERS / EXTRA_LINKS below;
to add a page, give it a title + description in PAGES and append it to a
cluster's members.
